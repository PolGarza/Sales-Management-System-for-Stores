# Sales Management System for Stores

This project is a desktop application developed in C# designed to manage sales in stores of any type. The application is structured using a 4-layer model (Views, Entities, Data, and Logic) to ensure a clear separation of responsibilities and better code maintainability.

**Note**: This is a project I completed for a university course. For this reason, there is no easy way to download and run it directly. The folders only contain the base code, not the installers.
